## My process
- Setup and organize files and folders.
- Dissect project briefing and determine the needed html elements.
- Once html skeleton is built, I then build out the skeleton css. 
- Putting base details in place, I then move to going in depth with the details and making any final tweaks.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3 

### What I learned

The first challenge definitely helped me move past some of the anxiety I have towards coding from scratch and I feel I'm really understanding you don't need to know everything from memory, rather, just know what to look up when the moment arises.

### Continued development

I definitely want to come back in the future and rework my initial design. I am very happy with what I've made the first round, but I am aware there is some room for improvment later down the line.
